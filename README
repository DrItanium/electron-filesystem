The theoretical-architecture is a virtual architecture that I'm creating to
explore different aspects of low-level system design.


This project depends on the electron platform to run. You will need to clone
the electron repo and build the executable. I have merge it with the electron
file system to make the simulator a toolchain that can exist on its own 
===========================================================================
This is the default filesystem that I use to write self contained programs that
use electron. This is possible due to the inclusion of shell variable access in
newer versions of electron.


The default file system is as follows

bin/ - binaries, shell scripts, and initializer electron code
lib/ - electron library code (use the import command to take advantage of it)
etc/ - contains files that define program variables and other such things
data/ - contains files generated by the program
src/ - contains the electron source code. DO NOT PUT YOUR ELECTRON FILES HERE.
       IF YOU DO THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING IT INTO THE LIB FOLDER

It should be noted that it is up to the programmer to customize this base
filesystem to suit their needs.
