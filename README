This is the default filesystem that I use to write self contained programs that
use electron. This is possible due to the inclusion of shell variable access in
newer versions of electron.

The default file system is as follows

conf/ - Contains configuration information
data/ - Default place to store input and output data
lib/ - User provided libraries
lib/sys/ - Contains system libraries and expert system chunks
logic/ - User provided expert systems
sys/ - Stores the native libraries and the electron executable 
sys/src - Contains electron source code and any other source code necessary
sys/bin - Contains the native electron binary
sys/include - Contains the headers for electron 
sys/lib - Contains dynamic and static libraries of electron and other libs

If you want to change things around then go ahead, just realize that this is 
the layout that is most logical to me.
