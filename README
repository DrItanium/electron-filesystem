This is the default filesystem that I use to write self contained programs that
use electron. This is possible due to the inclusion of shell variable access in
newer versions of electron.

The default file system is as follows

bin/ - (Optional) stores the electron executable
conf/ - Contains configuration information
data/ - Default place to store input and output data
lib/ - User provided libraries
logic/ - User provided expert systems
src/ - (Optional) Contains the electron runtime source code (C source)
sys/ - System libraries and expert system chunks


If you want to change things around then go ahead, just realize that this is 
the layout that is most logical to me.
